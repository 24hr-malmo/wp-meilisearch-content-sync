# Meilisearch Content sync plugin for WordPress

This is a simple plugin for WordPress that enables you to sync the content services with a Meilisearch instance.

This plugin assumes that you are using the https://gitlab.24hr.se/rawb/services/content-to-meilisearch-sync service, but it's not essential.

Once activated this plugin's page can be found under the tools menu at /wp-admin/tools.php?page=meilisearch-24hr-admin

To update, push a new tag to GitHub. Then login to https://packagist.org/packages/24hr/meilisearch as 24hrservices user and click 'Update'. This will fetch in the new tag.
